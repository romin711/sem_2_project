# 🛍️ E-Commerce Application (Java)

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This project implements a basic E-commerce application using Java. It encompasses fundamental features such as user management (customers, sellers, admins), product catalog, shopping cart, billing system, and data persistence using SQL.  The application demonstrates object-oriented programming principles and utilizes data structures like DoubleLinkedList and Stack, and uses SQL to persist data.

## Features

*   **User Management:** Registration and authentication for customers, sellers, and administrators.
*   **Product Catalog:** Listing and browsing of products.
*   **Shopping Cart:** Adding and managing items in a shopping cart.
*   **Billing System:** Calculation of order totals and processing payments (simulated).
*   **Data Persistence:** Storing and retrieving data from a SQL database using the provided `ecommerce.sql` script.
*   **Data Structures:** Utilizes DoubleLinkedList and Stack for specific functionalities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Java Development Kit (JDK) - version 8 or higher.
*   A relational database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
*   A suitable IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git # Replace with your repo URL.
    cd your-repository
    ```

2.  **Set up the database:**

    *   Create a new database in your chosen relational database system.
    *   Execute the `ECommerce/ecommerce.sql` script to create the necessary tables.

3.  **Configure the database connection:**

    *   Modify the `DBMS/DBConnection.java` file to specify your database connection details (URL, username, password).

4.  **Compile and run the application:**

    *   Open the project in your IDE.
    *   Compile the Java source files.
    *   Run the `Main.java` file.

## Usage

The `Main.java` file serves as the entry point for the application.  It will likely contain code demonstrating the use of the various classes and functionalities within the `ECommerce` directory.

Example Usage (Illustrative - code snippets will vary):

```java
// Example demonstrating creating a customer
Customer customer = new Customer("john.doe@example.com", "password123", "John Doe", "123 Main Street");
// Potentially a method to add/register the customer in the system would follow here.
```

## Data Model

The application's data model consists of several classes located in the `Model/` directory:

*   `User.java`: Abstract base class for users (customers, sellers, administrators).
*   `Customer.java`: Represents a customer.
*   `Seller.java`: Represents a seller.
*   `Admin.java`: Represents an administrator.
*   `CartItem.java`: Represents an item in the shopping cart.
*   `BillingSystem.java`: Handles billing-related operations.
*   `otp.java`: handles OTP operations for security
*   `validator.java`: handles input validation
* The database schema is defined in `ecommerce.sql`, which you should review for table structures and relationships.
